This is my art gallery website. I am a developer by day and artist by night.

Art has been a huge part of my life ever since I was a kid. But it hasn't always been an enjoyable part of it. When I was about 9 years old, I was asked by the adults in my life what I wanted to be when I grew up. Up until this point, I had recieved so much praise from these same adults for the art I was making. I was deluded into thinking that I was actually somewhat good for my age, so when I proudly declared that I was going to be an artist when I grew up, I was expecting the same praise and excitment as I had received before.

Instead, I was told that I should not be an artist when I grew up. I was so hurt, and so confused. These were the same people that praised me for my art and my passion for it. I was told that they just didn't want me to become a "starving artist". I kept asking over and over again "but I thought I was _good_ at art, why can't I be one when I grow up?". Only for "starving artist" to be thrown around some more.

Art, from that point forward, became a huge burden in my life. It no longer was a hobby that brought me joy, but was one that I was striving to be perfect at. Which while wasn't necessarily all bad, it sucked all the joy and passion I had for it. Instead of having fun and being creative, it just had to be perfect. That way, if it could be perfect, then maybe I could show all the adults in my life that I could actually be an artist when I grow up.

Well, I am not an artist by trade. I am a software developer and I adore my career. I don't regret the decision but it's one I most certainly made because of that day I was told I would turn out to be a "starving artist".

I started on an artistic journey about almost 4 years ago. I wanted to find joy in creating art once again. So in 2017, I started doing a sketch a day and a painting a week. It was an excersize I had done in university, and I figured if I could keep it up and not focus so much on perfection, I could find a love for art again.

I'm proud to say that I have found that passion once again, almost 20 years later. I haven't quite kept up with the quantity but I now regularly sit and draw and/or paint and I becoming totally immersed in it, without stressing and worrying about it being perfect. And I have found joy in it once again.

So please enjoy my gallery as much as I have enjoyed creating it.
